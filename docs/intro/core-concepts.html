                                <h1 id="core-concepts-of-taojs">Core Concepts of tao.js</h1>
<p>At the very heart of <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#taojs" class="glossary-term" title="The core library used to build applications and systems adhering to the TAO concepts">tao.js</a> is the concept of an Application Context (aka AppCon) described
using 3 Dimensions:</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>erm - the <em>thing</em> in the context - conceptually a domain entity<br><strong>A</strong>ction - the <em>operation</em> being performed on the <em>thing</em> in the context<br><strong>O</strong>rient(ation) - the <em>perspective</em> from which the User or Actor interacting with the system has
during this <em>operation</em> on this <em>thing</em></p>
<p>But before diving too deep into the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a>, there are a few preceding concepts that will help create
a deeper understanding as to why it is defined the way it is before explaining what
this represents or why it&apos;s beneficial.</p>
<p><em>Seriously, if you want to skip down below to the explanations about
<a href="#application-contexts-aka-appcons">Application Contexts</a> then be my guest.  However, you <strong>are</strong>
reading a page about the <strong>Core Concepts</strong> so it seems a bit base to skip ahead at this point.
If you don&apos;t care about a deep (or any) conceptual understanding of <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#taojs" class="glossary-term" title="The core library used to build applications and systems adhering to the TAO concepts">tao.js</a>, I don&apos;t blame you,
as it&apos;s entirely unnecessary to have in order to either use <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#taojs" class="glossary-term" title="The core library used to build applications and systems adhering to the TAO concepts">tao.js</a> or gain the <a href="benefits.html">Benefits</a>
of using it.  So please, if it suits you, by all means, skip over to the <a href="../basics">Basics</a>
and/or <a href="../advanced">Advanced</a> usage guides.  I&apos;m just sayin&apos;&#x2026;did you read the <a href="origin.html">Origin</a>
story?</em></p>
<h2 id="reactiveevented-application-building">Reactive/Evented Application Building</h2>
<p>I&apos;ve been obsessed with the concept of purely reactive application building for a long time now.
At the start of my professional career in development, I was building</p>
<p>The best way to build Reactive Applications is to use an Event-driven architecture like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" target="_blank">Observer Pattern</a> that ensures the code you
want to react to changes or messages is decoupled from the code that is generating the
interactions, events, and/or messages.  In this way, listeners (aka reactors) can be added
and removed at any time without any change to the generators.</p>
<h3 id="functions-messages-and-events">Functions, Messages, and Events</h3>
<p>Functions are the most basic unit of decoupling and decomposing programs into smaller units.</p>
<p>When learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), one of the concepts that stuck in my
head in the literature I read was that calling <em>Methods</em> on an <em>Object</em> is referred to
as &quot;passing <em>Messages</em>&quot; to that object.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-of-events">Evolution of Events</h3>
<p>What makes <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#taojs" class="glossary-term" title="The core library used to build applications and systems adhering to the TAO concepts">tao.js</a> and the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> unique is it&apos;s use of 3-Dimensional Event-like Handlers.</p>
<h4 id="1-dimensional-events">1-Dimensional Events</h4>
<p>Some frameworks like <a href="https://redux.js.org" target="_blank">Redux.js</a> or <a href="https://socket.io" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> provide
a 1-Dimensional form for <em>Events</em> using a single <code>String</code> as the name for the event that is
dispatched for various listeners (in Redux it&apos;s <code>reducer</code>s) which are subscribed to the event
by it&apos;s <code>String</code> name.  (In the case of Redux, <code>action</code>s of a <code>type</code> are dispatched and <code>reducer</code>s
act as listeners but receive all events and filter to only those for which they want to receive).</p>
<p>In order to overcome this limitation of a single dimension, most implementations end up defining
events using some sort of delimiter in the name to group events around common Terms, e.g.</p>
<pre class="language-"><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Definition of Redux.js action types as constants</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> SPACE_VIEW <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">&apos;space/VIEW&apos;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> SPACE_CREATE <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">&apos;space/CREATE&apos;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> SPACE_FIND <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">&apos;space/FIND&apos;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<h4 id="2-dimensional-events">2-Dimensional Events</h4>
<p>JavaScript&apos;s DOM and Node.js&apos; event model (via <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html" target="_blank"><code>EventEmitter</code></a>)
implementations are 2-Dimensional like most other implementations of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" target="_blank">Observer Pattern</a>.  2-Dimensional Events
provide the ability to specify a source <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> as well as the event being raised.</p>
<p>In single execution environments (like a browser or a single process) this is
implemented as the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> being the <em>Source</em> of the event and <em>Observers</em> registering
directly with the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> (or Object) <em>Source</em> for specific events, again defined by a
<code>String</code> name (in most cases) or by calling a specific registration method defined
for a given event.</p>
<p>In multi-process environments, 2-Dimensional Events are implemented using <em>Queues</em>
of <em>Messages</em> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern" target="_blank">Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) Pattern</a>.
The name of the <em>Queue</em> is akin to the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> and a type embedded in the <em>Message</em> is
congruent to the specific Event.</p>
<p>2-Dimensional Events are much improved over 1-Dimensional Events but still have limitations.
In single execution environments, <em>Observers</em> must know how to locate every <em>Object</em> (<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a>) and
individually subscribe to every event.  In multi-execution environments, each <em>Subscriber</em>
must know the location of every <em>Queue</em> or <em>Topic</em> (<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a>).  An additional limitation of
Pub-Sub pattern is the negotation of the encoding for messages in every individual <em>Queue</em>
or <em>Topic</em> that must take place for every <em>Subscriber</em> to know how to decode the <em>Messages</em>
as well as to ensure it has what it needs.</p>
<h4 id="3-dimensional-events">3-Dimensional Events</h4>
<p>The <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> uses AppCons to define a common 3-Dimensional Event across all execution environments
with the addition of the <em>Perspective</em> (aka Orient(ation)) to provide a more robust ability
to describe what takes place within an application or system of applications.</p>
<p>For example, within a single application, an <em>Event</em> such as <code>User</code> <code>Enter</code> has several
possible Orient(ation)s in order to exhaustively describe what is necessary for the application,
like: <code>Portal</code>, <code>Admin</code>, <code>Tracking</code> and <code>Reporting</code>.  Each of these example Orient(ation)s or
<em>Perspectives</em> transcribes a different set of needs on the <code>User</code> <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> and <code>Enter</code> <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#action" class="glossary-term" title="The active part of a TAO">Action</a>.</p>
<p>This is anlagous (but not congruent or completely the same) to having different Views
in a Relational Database for a single Table.</p>
<p>This 3rd Dimension provides the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> with the necessary comprehensiveness to describe all
possible events for a given application or system of applications.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-more-dimensions">Why not more Dimensions?</h4>
<p>I thought of this early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why not allow Events to be Tuples which can vary in size based on need?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated above, the 3rd Dimension provides enough meta-data for which to capture a definition
for all Events in a system that is exhuastive and sufficient.  The addition of more Dimensions
would increase the Complexity of the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> without adding additional benefit.</p>
<p>An individual AppCon also allows data to be attached to any of the 3 Dimensions of the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a>
to copmletely describe the individual AppCon.  In every case, it is possilble and relevant
to attach what is seen as an added dimension of data to the Orient(ation) for the AppCon.</p>
<h4 id="chained-events-become-protocols">Chained Events become Protocols</h4>
<h2 id="application-contexts-aka-appcons">Application Contexts (aka AppCons)</h2>
<p>As stated above, an AppCon or Event is defined across these three reference points (or as
written above - dimensions):</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>erm - the <em>thing</em> in the context - conceptually a domain entity<br><strong>A</strong>ction - the <em>operation</em> being performed on the <em>thing</em> in the context<br><strong>O</strong>rient(ation) - the <em>perspective</em> from which the User or Actor interacting with the system has
during this <em>operation</em> on this <em>thing</em></p>
<p>A good analogy for the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> is that of the grammatical parts to a sentence.</p>
<h3 id="terms"><em>T</em>erms</h3>
<p>Terms generally come from the Domain Model of an application or system of applications.  These
are the <em>things</em> we are attempting to model within our application that end up being stored
to a database somehwere or exist purely as a derivation of data within the executing environment.</p>
<p>A <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> may also be a <em>Relationship</em> between two or more <em>Entities</em>, and the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> does not care
to distinguish the difference between an <em>Entity</em> and <em>Relationship</em> <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a>.  In fact, it&apos;s
one of the powers of the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#tao" class="glossary-term" title="the basic library as well as the AC passed around">TAO</a> that <em>Relationships</em> are elevated to a first-class status
as a <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> to be reacted to just like an <em>Entity</em> can be.</p>
<p>From our sentence analogy, a <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> is the <em>Object</em> in the <em>Predicate</em> on which the AppCon is
occurring as it is transitioned to.</p>
<h3 id="actions"><em>A</em>ctions</h3>
<p>Actions are the <em>Operations</em> that are performed on or against a <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a>.</p>
<p>Actions are defined at a much more granular level than standard CRUD Operations so as to
provide a deeper meta-data model on which to interact and react.</p>
<p>In a traditional application where there is no stated goal to have uniform semantics across
all execution environments, the <strong>C</strong>(reate) of CRUD operations would be implemented using
an Event name like <code>&quot;CreateNew&quot;</code></p>
<p>From our sentence analogy, an <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#action" class="glossary-term" title="The active part of a TAO">Action</a> is the <em>Verb</em> of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="orientations"><em>O</em>rient(ation)s</h3>
<p>Orient(ation)s are the <em>Perspectives</em> taken by the <em>Actor</em> that is either interacting or observing
the application or system of applications at the time of the AppCon.</p>
<p>Orient(ation)s allow for an effective way for the system to act or react differently for the
same <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#action" class="glossary-term" title="The active part of a TAO">Action</a> operating on the same <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#term" class="glossary-term" title="The what? of a TAO">Term</a> by describing a unique context.</p>
<p>From our sentence analogy, an Orient(ation) is the Subject or Actor that is acting out the verb
on the object.</p>
<h2 id="user-model">U.S.E.R. Model</h2>
<p>Along my journey towards creating <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#taojs" class="glossary-term" title="The core library used to build applications and systems adhering to the TAO concepts">tao.js</a> I came to the conclusion that after defining your
domain model, if you use the <em>Reference Point</em> of considering each of your <em>Entities</em> in a
3-Dimensional <em>Space</em>, then it becomes very easy to define and describe the Actions a <em>User</em>
can take on each model as well as your whole system.</p>
<p>This led me to define the <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>S</strong>patial <strong>E</strong>ntity <strong>R</strong>eference Model (U.S.E.R. Model
for short) as a Tool by which to discover and document <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case" target="_blank">Use Cases</a>
using AppCons.</p>
<p>The essential outcome of the U.S.E.R. Model is that it defines a set of Actions that <em>can</em> be
applied to all Terms in all Orientations as a <em>Super Set</em> of possible AppCons for your
Application, and eliminates the guess work for how to define Actions for your system,
speeding up the process of defining and building your applications.</p>
<p>The list of Actions defined by the U.S.E.R. Model is:</p>
<ul>
<li>New</li>
<li>Add</li>
<li>Edit</li>
<li>Update</li>
<li>Store</li>
<li>Retrieve</li>
<li>Find</li>
<li>Enter</li>
<li>View</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more about the U.S.E.R. Model, please see my post entitled <a href="https://link.to.blog/i-never-wrote" target="_blank">Every Use Case Ever Written</a>.</p>
<h2 id="appcons-as-a-universal-message-format">AppCons as a Universal Message Format</h2>
