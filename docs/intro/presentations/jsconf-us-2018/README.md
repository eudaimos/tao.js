# Presentation @ JSConf US 2018

**Date:** August 21, 2018
**Time:** 5:00 pm  
**Location:** Carlsbad, CA

**Name:** Jeff Hoffer

**Title:**
We're the same you and me - A new _Way_ ☯ to Align Programming Paradigms across Client & Server(less)

**Description:**

Despite JavaScript now being used to program _literally_ everywhere (or is it figuratively?), we still
make a distinction between Front-End and Back-End programming along with our constant search for the
✌ Full-Stack ✌ Programmer.  If we're _literally_ writing in the same language (I know it's right
this time), then it doesn't have to be this way.  
  
Let's go _Full Reactive_ to build completely Event-driven Systems as called for by the
[Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org) and move towards a new _Way_ of programming
that doesn't care in what execution environment our code is running, allowing us to write
virtually the same code for everywhere.  Along the way we will discover that by designing software
this way it is easier to stave off _Technical Debt_ and describe the system to product
stakeholders using a _Grammar_ that makes it clearer for us to build the right software.  
  
Using a tiny library called `tao.js` (☯.js) that provides a richer 3-Dimensional Event-like descriptor
[as *T*erm *A*ction *O*rient(ation)] to align how all events within any system are described & fired,
I will demonstrate how we can have everything we want with some amazing additional benefits:  
  
1. Build with an Architecture that is _designed to Evolve_
1. Build your entire system to be composable and decoupled from day `0`
1. Use the best tool for the job, not be locked into any particular framework or database
1. Build Reactive Applications that have common semantics across all execution stacks
  (clients, servers & serverless) so code lives anywhere and everywhere
1. Get Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) (aka cross-cutting) System-wide for free
1. Collaboratively & rapidly describe the software you're going to build with Product members of your team...
1. ...and Translate those descriptions directly into code
