# Using `tao.js` Server-side

One of the goals of `tao.js` is a unified programming paradigm across all execution environments.
While you can utilize the library easily in your server-side applications, use these packages
to make the implementation seamless and easy:

* [Socket.io](socket-io.md) - easily integrate `tao.js` with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) on
  Client & Server for seamless `tao.js` programming across an entire application
* [Koa Middleware](koa.md) - _coming soon_
* [Connect/Express Middlware](connect.md) - _coming soon_
