# Basics of using `tao.js`

There are 3 basic topics to understand in order to get started building apps with tao.js:

* [Application Contexts (AppCons)](app-cons.md) - how to define and set Application Contexts for
  your application
* [Handlers for AppCons](handlers.md) - how to add handlers to the TAO that are triggered when
  an Application Context is set
* [Chaining AppCons](chaining.md) - how to chain Application Contexts to trigger AppCons from
  handlers
* [Wildcard Handlers](wildcards.md) - how to utilize handlers for AppCons with Wildcards to capture
  more Application Contexts than just individual Concretely defined AppCons
